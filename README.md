If there is more than one minimal weighted tree (because of a tie among edges, for example), you may return any of them.<br>
Test Files:<br>
g.txt (10 vertices)<br>
The minimal weighted tree contains 9 edges and has a total weight of 12. The tree must contain these edges:<br> (1,9),(2,7),(2,8),(2,10),(3,5),(3,6),(4,6),(5,9),(7,9).<br>
h.txt (25 vertices)<br>
The minimal weighted tree contains 24 edges and has a total weight of 33. (There is more than one possible tree.)<br>
j.txt (40 vertices)<br>
The minimal weighted tree contains 39 edges and has a total weight of 45. There is more than one possible tree, but any valid tree <br> contain exactly one edge of weight 3, 4 edges of weight 2, and 34 edges of weight 1.<br>
